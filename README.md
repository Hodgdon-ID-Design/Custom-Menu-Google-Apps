# Custom-Menu-Google-Apps
This JavaScript code was created by me and used to generate custom menus in our spreadsheets. These menus enabled users to execute commands without the need to write any code. This functionality was particularly valuable for our LMS administrators, as they needed to regularly review admin and user lists to monitor additions and removals.

Please read wiki for directions on how to use the code.
